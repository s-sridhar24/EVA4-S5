This folder contains 5 files, one for each step of MNIST Image Recognition Assignment using PyTorch.

Each file itself contains three cells at the top showing Program Objectives, Step Objectives, Step Results and Analysis and Also the Parameters / RF computation pasted from a Excel.

There is a link to open the file in Colab also.

This was one of the best tutorials I have been through, helped me learn a lot of concepts and also try out things.

CNN cannot be learnt without such a task.
